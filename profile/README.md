üëã Hello!  I'm [Jan](https://github.com/jehrhardt), the founder of the Cozy Stack. As someone who's passionate about quality, security, and making innovative solutions accessible to everyone, I've created the Cozy Stack as a place for commercial open-source projects that reflect my values.

Cozy Stack is a space where we can work together to build something truly valuable ‚Äì without sacrificing our well-being or the planet. By joining this journey, you'll be part of a movement that believes in treating others with respect, empathy, and kindness. We'll collaborate on open-source projects, share knowledge, and support each other's growth. Who knows? You might even find yourself contributing to one of my projects or starting your own!
